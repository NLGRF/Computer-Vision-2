**Project Title**

A custom object identification and classification of onions and tomatoes using EfficientDet 

**Project Description**

This video illustrates a real-time object identification and classification of onions and tomatoes using custom efficientDet; which is one of the object detection neural network architecture provided in TensorFlow 2 zoo. The tomatoes and onions were locally collected. This architecture was fully trained using google colab. The dataset was converted to tensorflow record using roboflow. 

**About EfficientDet**

EfficientDets is a family of object detection models, which achieves state-of-the-art 55.1mAP (mean average precision) on COCO test-dev, yet being 4x - 9x smaller and using 13x - 42x fewer FLOPs than previous detectors. The model also run 2x - 4x faster on GPU, and 5x - 11x faster on CPU than other detectors. Read more about this architecture from the paper below.
