**Project Title***

TensorFlow Implementation of object detection model (MOBILENET v3) for static videos

**Project Description**

This video illustrates a real-time object identification and classification of onions and tomatoes using custom efficientDet; which is one of the object detection neural network architecture provided in TensorFlow 2 zoo. The tomatoes and onions were locally collected. This architecture was fully trained using google colab. The dataset was converted to tensorflow record using roboflow.
